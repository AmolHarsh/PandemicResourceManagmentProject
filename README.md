## Machine Learning for Optimal Medical Aid Distribution: Data Analysis and Normalization Techniques
## Brief Description

The "Machine Learning for Optimal Medical Distribution" project, under Prof. Amrik Sen's guidance at Plaksha University, represents a significant stride in employing data science and machine learning for enhancing public health crisis management. While the ultimate goal of the project is to develop a Machine Learning-based system for the optimal distribution of medical resources, this repository specifically contains code and documentation for a comprehensive data analysis and normalization environment. Focused on pandemic resource management, it utilizes an extensive dataset from 49 European countries to facilitate the manipulation and visualization of complex data sets, thereby supporting more informed decision-making in public health crises.

## Introduction

This project's code and documentation, created by Amol Harsh in collaboration with Abhigyan Mehrotra, provides a comprehensive environment for data analysis and normalization techniques related to pandemic resource management. It allows users to manipulate and visualize complex data sets effortlessly, aiming to enhance decision-making in public health crises.

## Features

(1) Data cleaning and preprocessing for effective analysis.

(2) Various normalization techniques including Global Static, Global Dynamic Max, and Global Dynamic Mean.

(3) Core functionalities for visualizing specific country data and pandemic trends.

(4) Generation and analysis of probability transition matrices to understand COVID-19 severity transitions.

# Data Analysis and Normalization Techniques

(1) Extensive analysis of European COVID-19 data spanning 2.5 years.

(2) Application of Moving Average Method, feature scaling, and rolling averages for trend identification.

(3) Detailed methodology for normalization techniques and their impact on data interpretation.

## Visualization and Methodology
